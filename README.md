# NullPoint

## Overview

NullPoint is an experimental project whose goal is to build a complete computing system from first principles.  
The project explores the construction of a minimal operating system for embedded or bare-metal environments, alongside a custom runtime, programming language, and compiler.

Rather than aiming for production readiness, NullPoint is designed as a long-term learning and research project focused on understanding how software systems are built from the hardware level upward.

---

## Goals

- Understand the boot process and bare-metal execution.
- Design and implement a minimal kernel.
- Explore memory management, task scheduling, and hardware abstraction.
- Build a custom runtime environment.
- Design a programming language tailored for low-level systems.
- Implement a compiler or transpiler targeting the NullPoint runtime.
- Maintain full control and transparency across all system layers.

---

## Scope

NullPoint is intentionally ambitious. The scope includes, but is not limited to:

- Bootloader and system initialization
- Kernel architecture (monolithic or microkernel, to be determined)
- Interrupt handling and basic scheduling
- Memory management primitives
- Device interaction (initially minimal)
- Runtime support for a custom language
- Language design and compiler implementation

The project prioritizes understanding and experimentation over performance or completeness.

---

## Philosophy

NullPoint follows these principles:

- No hidden abstractions  
- Minimal external dependencies  
- Explicit control over system behavior  
- Learning-driven development  

Every component exists to be understood, modified, and questioned.

## Intended Audience

This project is primarily intended for educational and research purposes.  
It is suitable for developers interested in:

- Operating systems
- Embedded systems
- Low-level programming
- Compilers and language design
- Systems architecture

---

## Project Status

NullPoint is in early development.  
Many design decisions are still open and will evolve as the project progresses.
